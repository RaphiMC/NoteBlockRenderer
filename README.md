## Usage
### Loading a song

dragging and dropping a song file into the table,
or by entering a NoteBlockWorld song URL into the input field and clicking the "Load song" button.

### Loading custom sounds (Optional)
After loading a song, you can see the instrument list and optionally load custom sounds.
NoteBlockRenderer will automatically download vanilla Minecraft sounds from the official Mojang servers.
If you want to use your own custom sounds, click the "Choose folder" button in the "Custom Sounds" section and select the folder containing your custom sounds.

### Rendering the song
To render the song to an audio file, click the "Render" button. This will open the render dialog where you can configure the audio format, playback and rendering options.
The default options usually work great as they are, but you can change them if you want to customize the output.
After configuring the options, click the "Render" button in the dialog to start rendering the song.

### Downloading the audio file
After the rendering is complete, a green box will appear at the bottom of the dialog with a preview of the rendered audio file and a download button.
Optionally there can also be warning messages if some instrument sounds are missing.
